example
=========
You can download our example data from `here <>`_

bam file
~~~~~~~~~
We selected 20 sample's bam files of Small Intestine Terminal Ileum tissue from GTEX, and extracted all sequencing reads which mapped to chromosome 10 using samtools as an example data. Look up `documents on github <https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf>`_ for more infomation.

vcf file
~~~~~~~~~
For above 20 sample, we integrated their variant infomation of chromsome 10 in a vcf file. More specification info of VCF format can be found in `documents on github <http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf>`_

GTF file
~~~~~~~~~
Genome annotation file is download from `gencode website <https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/release_26.html>`_ with Release 26(GRCh38.p10). In order to run MODER more quickly, in our example data, we only provide genome annotation info of chromosome 10. Refer to `Ensemble-GFF/GTF File Format <http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html?redirect=no#:~:text=The%20GFF%20%28General%20Feature%20Format%29%20format%20consists%20of,to%20GFF%20version%202.%20Fields%20must%20be%20tab-separated.>`_ for more info of GTF format.
